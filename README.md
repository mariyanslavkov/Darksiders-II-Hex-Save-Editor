# Darksiders II Save File Fixer

This is a simple GUI-based tool built in Java to fix Darksiders II save files. When trying to download a save off the internet, it doesn't show up in the game most of the time despite putting it in the correct folders. What this tool does is get hex values that are specific to your system and save, replacing them in the downloaded save, so it can work on your PC.
